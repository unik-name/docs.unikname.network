## Implication behind the choice of your name and your type

It is important to understand the implications behind the choice of name and type of your @unikname.

::: warning
Once it is created, it cannot be changed.
:::

For the type of your @unikname, you will have the choice between two types of @unikname:

- `individual`
- `organization`

Unless you are a company, **choose individual**.

Indeed, in order to become a delegate, you will need to gather votes.
Only individuals vote for individuals, and only organizations vote for organizations.

If you are an individual and create an organization @unikname, then you will have a hard time collecting votes.

## Requirement before going further

Before going any further, the procedure to become a Network Player requires a few prerequisites.

Notably the fact of being able to run a Blockchain node, which requires **having a server**.
If you don't have one, and you don't want one, you won't be able to configure your node, nor join the network.

And for those who have all this, welcome to the community!

Now let's go creating your @unikname as an individual by going to the [next part of this documentation](./creating-your-unikname-individual).

::: tip organization @unikname

If you have decided to create an `organization` @unikname, follow [this part of the documentation instead](./creating-unikname-organization).
