# Our UNIK Decentralized IDentifiers (DID)

## DID Remarkable properties

Any Decentralized IDentifiers, also called DID, have remarkable properties which make them the legitimate successor of traditional identifiers:

- DID are under the sole control of their owner
- DID ower is the only one to decide who can access data related to its ID
- DID are available every time and everywhere around the world
- DID are immutable, once minted, they can't be modified nor destructed
- DID are unique on a global network, by definition
- DID lifetime is everlasting
- DID can byanonymized, and their use untraceable in a P2P context

Our UNIK DID have all these remarkable properties.

## DIDs only exist in a Decentralized Network

A Decentralized Network...
- relies on many independent actors from each other
- is publicly accessible
- has a decentralized governance, independent of a country (such as an international foundation)
- is reliable, resilient, incorruptible, resistant to censorship, efficient

…providing DID…
- is accessible at low cost
- provide « International IDs», not only latin nor ascii ones
- rewards securing and using DIDs
- guarantees the absolute sovereignty of IDs

…self-controls their creation.

<uns/> meets all these criteria, making it the ideal Decentralized Network for DIDs

## What makes UNIK DID so unique ?

1. DID UNIK are anonymous **Identifers**, they are **not proof of digital identity**. 
1. DID UNIK can be transposed into **Universal** Identifiers: @unikname. They're Human-Readable and **protected against typo-squatting** thanks to ``SafeTypo ©`` algorythm.
1. DID UNIK **belong to namespaces**, called types, defining their purpose.
1. DID UNIK have **configurable governance rules** specific to their type.
1. DID UNIK embed **exclusive features for authentication**
1. DID UNIK have **advanced data registries** (on-chain, off-chain, encrypted…)
