# Powered by ARK.IO

@unik-name and its UNS blockchain, has been built uppon ARK.io blockchain. Technically 'UNS core' and 'UNS Explorer' are forks from 'ARK core' and 'Ark Explorer'.

In doing such we've contributed to the ARK developements. We're participating to code improvement and we're the core developpers of the NFT module of ARK, enabling management of Non Fungible Tokens with the ARK.io Blockchain. 

To get more information about the ARK.io blockchain we recommend the [documentation of ARK.io](https://arkdoc-23.docs.uns.network). This is snapshot of the doc of the Version 2.3 on which we've built our current UNS blockchain version.
