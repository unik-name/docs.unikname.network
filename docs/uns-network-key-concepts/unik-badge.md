# Key Concept: DID UNIK Badges

Each @unikname is assigned trust badges. They provide information on the qualities of each DID UNIK NFT and its involvement in the network.

<small>_example of badges displayed in the header section of @jack-sparrow_</small>

Badges take the form of On-Chain properties and are always Disclosed, regardless of the visibility of the UNIK.

The badges are accessible with the Resolver within the path "Badges/".

There are two types of badges, singular ones and enumerated ones, belonging to families.

The badges are returned by the APIs, the CLI, and are visible on the chain explorer.

## Why Badges?

**Badges contribute to build trust in the network**. They give indications on the quality and legitimacy of each @unikname.
